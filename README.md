# üåç Twentieth-Century Global Relations Analysis

## Objective  
As a **freelance analyst** contracted by the **Institute for Public Policy**, this project aims to provide an analytical overview and visualization of global interrelations throughout the twentieth century. By examining historical ties between countries, the goal is to uncover patterns in geopolitical relationships and inform ongoing research.

## Context  
The **Institute for Public Policy** believes that historical events heavily shape modern geopolitics. To validate this hypothesis, a **visual representation of past relationships** is needed.  
- The project will **analyze major global events** from the twentieth century and trace the interconnections between nations.  
- The **final visualization** will highlight these relationships to support researchers in contextualizing findings within the larger initiative.  

## Data and Tools  
This project requires **web scraping** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to extract and analyze historical data. The following tools and libraries will be used:  
- **Data Collection & Processing:** `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`, `pandas`  
- **Text Mining & NLP:** `NLTK`, `spaCy`  
- **Network Analysis & Visualization:** `NetworkX`, `Plotly`, `Gephi`  

### Data Sourcing Criteria  
- Scrape **a list of countries** from a web page.  
- Scrape **historical and political content** from **Wikipedia** (focusing on the twentieth century).  

## Analysis Approach  
- Apply **NLP techniques** to extract country mentions and interactions from historical text.  
- Identify **centrality measures** (`degree`, `closeness`, and `betweenness centrality`) to determine each country‚Äôs influence.  

## Visualization & Network Mapping  
A **dynamic network chart** will visually represent geopolitical relationships, featuring:  
- **Clear distinctions** between different relationships and communities within the network.  
- **An interactive design** that allows users to explore country interrelations dynamically.  
- **A refined, polished chart** for easy interpretation by researchers and the public.  

## Success Factors  
- Deliver a **professional network visualization** that accurately depicts international relations.  
- Ensure the visualization is **intuitive and informative** for policymakers and researchers.  
- Provide insights that align with the **institute‚Äôs broader research objectives**.
